Maintain state using Redux. 

Data coming from DB is a state.

Date is available in tree structure.

Business Logic makes a call using AJAX to the DB and gets the data.

Component tree + State tree = DOM tree


State management was done using Flux in past. But not it is Redux. Disadv of Flux is that they had multiple stores which caused issues. 

Reusuable service libraries are created usin Redux. 


MVC and MVVM is too difficult to manage, hence FB went for Redux which uses uni directional flows.


Andular 1, MVC, Angular 2 uni directional arch.



Minimal key updates will happen using Immutable.js (a technique to apply the changes)



Redux store provides API to maintain the store, state etc. No business logic here. Only data.


Action 

 - any change that caused application change is action
 - has action type and payload.


Reducers
********

We will write a switch case, i.e based on actions what has to be done.

Actions goes to Reducers.

Reducers takes an action and update part of application state. All business logic resides in the reducers.

Unit testing can be done using Mocha or Jasmine.


From UI, now the store has changed. 

Container has to subscribe to store so that it gets the update from the store. For that we have the Provider.


Two types of components.

Container component  - Consumers
Dumb components - Textboxes etc (No handlers, they have only props) 


Store to container is PUSH based.


Whenever state is changed, DOM tree string is re-rendered. Which will kill performance so keep the DOM limited.

Entire string is parsed, diffing and reconcilation algo is applied and re-rendered.



All reducers are pure functions.


Providers
*********

Makes stire availabe to all containers.


Containers
**********

Fetch app state data and use it to render.


Componenets
***********
Application states are changed its updated.


AXIOS middleware
****************

Between Action and Reducers we have a middle ware. Eg: Axios middleware

Between action and Reducer exists the Middleware

Middleware is just JS methods.


Limitations
***********

Nested containers not possbile.
More than one reducers possible.

react-redux plugin offers connectivity between Store and container.

babel-polyfill - for cross browser compatibility





index.js used to combine all the files.

Say in reducers folder we have index.js which combines all the reducers.

when we use command import allReducers from './reducers' it looks for index.js and it combines all the reducers.
